Got some inspiration and basic idea from Developer Rahul and then started doing this looks fun to play with it. 

What's different from Rahul sir is that i used my phones camera to visualize and not my laptops . 

If You also wish to use your phones camers , download IPWEBCam and start the server , here in the code file , change your IP in line 232 in index.html
